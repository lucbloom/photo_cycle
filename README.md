# The Photo Cycle
A multi-monitor screensaver that cycles your photos.

Features:
- Display time
- Fade time
- Pan-and-scan strength
- Multiple include paths
- Multiple exclude paths (e.g. "C:\My Photos\Receipts" or "C:\My Photos\Spicy nudes")
- Pause the animations with P
- Toggle caption with T
- Flip forward and backward with arrow keys
- Always fill the screen, no matter the aspect ratio or zoom level
- Optional caption: date + folder of origin (e.g. Kopenhagen 22-07-2012)
- Background color (for images with transparency)
- Synchronized cycle or one-by-one per monitor
- Option to only use a single screen (black on the rest)
- Settings dialog via Screen Save Settings
- A cool logo

Technical:
- Working preview in Screen Save Settings
- Date is scanned from EXIF info, then looks for a date in the filename, then goes for file creation date
- Font options for the caption: font, size, outline width, font color, ouline color
- Made with the help of various A.I.s, mostly ChatGPT and Claude

TODO:
- The little preview shows the desktop when editing settings
- I could not get outlines to work easily in DirectWrite. If anyone is an expert, I'd like to hear it

Roadmap:
I think this is a fine little program unless someone has a great idea.
